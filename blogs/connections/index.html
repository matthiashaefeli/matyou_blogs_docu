    <h2>SSH</h2>
    <p>
      SSH, or Secure Shell, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and
      modify their remote servers over the internet. The service uses cryptographic techniques
      to ensure that all communication to and from the remote server happens in an encrypted
      manner. SSH is typically used to log into a remote machine and execute commands in the same manner
      as you would if you were physically opertaing the remote computer.
