    <h2>Create a Cron Job Monitor Tool</h2>
    <p>
      We never know if a cron job works or not until we notice an error or a user is complaining about something that is not working.<br>
      How can we prevent something like that?<br>
      We could set up an email, everytime the job runs we get a confirmation email.<br>
      But with too many cron jobs we would lose the overview, and if we have a cron job that runs every 5 minutes, we would get an email every 5 minutes.<br>
      That's too much!<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      I was searching online for solution, and there are a lot of tools to monitor the cron job,<br>
      but you have to register and if you have many cron jobs to monitor you have to pay for it.
    </p>
    <h3>So I decided to create my own monitor tool.</h3>
    <p>
      First, we know that we can send a post request from the command line with the curl command.<br>
      If we do something like that:
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="code">
    <br>
    <p>
      curl https://www.google.com/
    </p>
    <br>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
    <p>
      We get a response with the content of the page.<br>
      We can also do a curl with parameters and hit a method to post something, and that is what we need.<br>
      We need to know what cron job it is and maybe a verification code to prevent a hacker attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      We already have a running Rails app, so we need to add the monitor controller and model.<br>
      I am not going into details to create the controller and model. (create a Rails app and add controllers and models is another blog)<br>
      But i created a cron job model with name, verification and schedule.<br>
      For schedule i used the cron job schedule like <b>10 * * * *</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>gem 'parse-cron'</h3>
    <p>
      This gem was really helpfull to convert the cron job schedule into ruby time. And i used the converter to check<br>
      what was the schedule for the last run and what is the schedule for the next run. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Linux command line with the command crontab -l we can see the list of all running con jobs.<br>
      With the command crontab -e we can edit those commands.<br>
      If we have a cron job like:
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="code_wide">
    <br>
    <p>
      0,14,24,34,44,54 * * * * /home/admin/bin/do_some_stuff.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
    </p>
    <br>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
    <p>
      I added the following curl command before the >/dev/null
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="code_wide">
    <br>
    <p>
      && curl https://test.com/cron_job_monitor/monitor/do_some_stuff=LKAX3W-8GR7-56785L
    </p>
    <br>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
    <p>
      do_some_stuff is the name of the cron job and the key is to verify the cron job.<br>
      The only thing to do, is create the controller method monitor to handle the request.<br>
      We verify the cron job by name and verification code, and create a new db entrance with the name and time.<br>
      Now we know (thanks to the gem 'parse-cron') when should the cron job have been running and we can compare the times.
