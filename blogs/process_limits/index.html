    <h1>Process Limits</h1>
    <p>
      Last Week I had an interesting case.<br>
      In our rails app, on the startup we open different files and read the first lines.<br>
      In production and on different development environments that works perfect.<br>
      But on other development environments the app crashes every time.<br>
      The only error we get, is: Can't read the file file_name.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      First we checked if we had other different file permissions.<br>
      That was not the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we figured out that if we do:
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="code">
    <br>
      <p>
        file = File.open(filename)<br>
        lines = file.readlines<br>
        lines.each do |line|<br>
        <span class="tab">do_something</span><br>
        end<br>
      </p>
    <br>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
    <p>
      The file will be closed after a while, however, we don't know when, so many files may be open ( high garbage collection )
    </p>
    <p>
      So we changed that code to:
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="code">
    <br>
    <p>
      File.open(filename) do |file|<br>
      <span class="tab">lines = file.readlines</span><br>
      <span class="tab">lines.each do |line|</span><br>
      <span class="tab_two">do_something</span><br>
      <span class="tab">end</span><br>
      end
    </p>
    <br>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
    <p>
      The file close automatically after the end of the process( no garbage collection)
    </p>
    <p>
      So this helped in some of the development environments, but on others we still had the same problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      After setting Pry on different locations we figured out that we have still the problem with to many open files (Errno::EMFILE).<br>
      More research and we figured out that Errno::EMFILE is due to the ruby process opening too many files.<br>
      ulimit -- get and set process limits. This limit can be seen and set with
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="code">
    <br>
    <p>
      $ ulimit -n<br>
      256<br>
      $ ulimit -n 1024<br>
      $ ulimit -n<br>
      1024
    </p>
    <br>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
    <p>We changed that limit and voila the problem was gone!</p>
