# React create app favicon

There is a file titled favicon.icon in the public folder. Just change that file with your favicon.

In the same folder is the manifest.js file with the coe below
```
"icons": [
  {
    "src": "favicon.ico",
    "sizes": "64x64 32x32 24x24 16x16",
    "type": "image/x-icon"
  },
```

You can add your favicon icon and change the name in the manifest.js file.
