# How to commit with a subject line and message body

git commit without -m will start an editor and you can enter the commit on multiline. Save the commit and exit with :wq

If you prefer do everything from a single command you can use the git commit -m like below

```
git commit -m "this is the subject" -m "this is the body"
```
